I'm finally learning, oh yes.

The reason IDE's make it so difficult to copy folders around is because it's an incredibly difficult process. In order to copy in Subversion you have to copy the folders/files, delete any .svn directories in each level of a folder, then those folders/files have to be added to the repo.

Very complicated process which has been killing me lately. I should have known better; how not DRY of me to copy a folder...
