What do I want to say?

There are no strong developers left in Portland
  At least, none for hire
  Do we really want to survive entirely on poaching
  Can we rely on poaching other markets?

Where do strong developers come from?
  Varied projects w/ new technologies
  Interacting with other strong developers
  Teaching other developers
  Expanding mental horizons
  Branding

Making strong developers sounds time consuming!

Okay, lets do it!
  Teaching / Varied Technologies
    Lightning talks (40 people == 1 / every other week)
    Blogging (notify in the chatroom / email on publish)
    Book club (12 weeks max)
    Friday science newsletter (every other week)
    Hack day / 20% time

  Branding your devs
    Hosting tech _and_ non-tech events
    Marketing their work / blogs
    Sponsor conferences they speak at
    Encourage speaking at conferences

  Interacting
    Host-a-hacker
    Encourage open source contributions
    Guest speakers

  Expanding mental horizons / practice
    Music time / music area
    Team-building art time
    Monday RubyQuiz / Kata

Why senior developers < strong developers
