RBridge has undergone a lot of bug fixes and I think it's worthy of a 0.2 release at long last.

1 major enhancement

* Actually runs headless via the rulang command.

3 minor enhancements

* Uses optparse for clearer command-line options.
* Option to specify port, compile directory, mnesia directory, sname, and location of server file.
* Some error checking, and debug output added. Checks to see if server is already running on specified port.

You can check it out "here":http://ruby-mnesia.rubyforge.org or just <i>gem install rbridge</i>
