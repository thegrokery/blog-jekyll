Someone pointed out the other day that most people in Shanghai have been driving less than a year, many for around nine months as that's how long the test takes to prep for (iirc). Imagine a city with about 1 million cars on the road, all of which are driven by people with the same experience level as an average 16 year old. Now try riding on the back of a taxi-motorcycle! :)
