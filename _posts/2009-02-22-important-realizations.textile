Today I learned several things, but the most important is a skill I think I will probably be able to use with success for the rest of my life: how to turn off my brain's gag reflex. Tied to the important message of never asking what it is I'm putting into my mouth and who it used to belong to I believe that I will experience many, many more foods in the future.

Also, I didn't know that real bananas are extremely small. I bought my normal amount of bananas today but it to get the required volume I had to buy like 30 bananas. Too big to be the weird purple tiny bananas I see in the states, too small to be the genetically modified things we call bananas in the states. I haven't tried them yet but I'm getting excited about the prospect of it already.

Also, I saw a feral kitten playing in a grocery store. It was under a table playing with the table cloth like kittens do. For some reason I assumed that feral kittens didn't play but I guess either my original assumption was wrong or it's actually the clerks kitten and I just totally misunderstood the situation. I smiled either way and the clerk looked at my confused when I tried to tell her that the kitten was cute. Stupid tonal language: I probably told her that I loved the hat dispenser or something.
