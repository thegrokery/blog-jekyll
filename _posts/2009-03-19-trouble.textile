Today I had an exam that went well, at least the written part seemed to go well. But the spoken part was fairly dull and my teacher lambasted me for not speaking Chinese enough outside of class. Specifically she said that while all the other students are learning new words outside of class I am not, nor am I learning new grammar structures. Of course she is right so I'm going to make an attempt to speak only Chinese and keep a book handy for new phrases I learn. Maybe next exam will be better.

When a subject matter is inherently multi-person it doesn't help to be self-taught.
